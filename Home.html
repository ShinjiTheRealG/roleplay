                <p class="scrollabletextbox u-text u-text-4"> Fear was born as any other human was, but he had a strange affliction. This affliction was a rare curse that became commonly known as "shadow-touched." Shadow-touched children were considered bad omens and usually casted out from the community in which they were born. Abandoned at a young age, Fear still does not know who his real parents are. His earliest memories are with a group of demons known as Reapers. Reapers exist to find and extract souls from living beings and return them to the underworld. There are more nuances to this, but this is their natural function, just as predator eat prey. This peculiar group of demons had found Fear abandoned and wanted to use him for his power. They seemed to know something about his power that he did not. To this day, he still doesn't know the secrets behind his power.&nbsp; Nonetheless they kept him alive and helped him develop his abilities.<br>
                  <br>When Fear was only around 6 years old, he began killing for the Reapers. The method was the same. He would find a warrior and challenge them to battle. If they agreed, he would kill them and alert the demons of the freed soul. With the combination of his dark aura and powerful skills, he began to gain some notoreity.&nbsp; The public gave him the name "Fear."&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>As he killed more, he began to attract unwanted attention. Many people considered him a traitor, a vile human living amongst demons.&nbsp; Now, besides killing for the Reapers, he was killing in self defense. Anyone who raised their weapon against him was shown no mercy. Well, to Fear, a quick death was mercy.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear saw the Reapers as a means for survival. Each individual Reaper was a full character on their own, and most of them he did not like because of fundamental character flaws. Still, he chose to remain with them and develop his power. His relationship with them was stable until one day when he was 16, he was ordered to kill an entire town.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Why should I kill these people?" Fear asked, his blank, heavy stare piercing Vladinin.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>The elder demon glared back. He did not like being questioned. However, this was rare from his pupil, so he restrained himself and played along. "Why not? You've killed thousands by now."<br>
                  <br>"But they agree to combat. They acknowledge that they are facing death and agree to it.&nbsp; I shouldn't kill people who have not asked for it," Fear replied, hardly any emotion flowing through his words.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>The demon was stunned for a good moment. Had his pupil held on to these foolish human principles this whole time? "This task must be done. If you are unwilling to do it, then you are free to leave. However..." he said, his aura burning during this pause. "Should we meet after your departure, your life will end."&nbsp; Such warm words from a parental figure.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear paused for a moment, thinking over the situation. ".... What will happen to these people if I leave?"&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Then I will kill them myself. There are things in motion beyond your understanding. You have until six nightfalls to make up your mind. Don't be foolish."&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear left to think about this. He decided to spend a few days in the town that he was scheduled to massacre. Normally, Fear was not very talkative or interested in humans. However... despite having killed thousands, this seemed like the first time he would actually kill. There was something alarming about killing someone against their will. Fear looked at himself through the reflection in his blade. Who was he? Why was he thinking these things? Why should he care about the humans that abandoned him? Deeply troubled by confusing thoughts and lack of answers, he started down a mental spiral. Soon enough, he found himself holding his blade against the throat of a young child. The child must have been only 3 or 4 years old. Fear was testing himself. He was a monster, wasn't he? Killing is killing. It should be easy, he told himself. However, as the sharp blade pressed into the flesh of the child, on the cusp of drawing blood, his arm wouldn't move. His red eyes met the young girls. Her eyes were blue and wide. Her expression was... not of fear or terror, no, she was curious and... optimistic?&nbsp; This was alarmingly different. He realized that her life had been of peace, so peaceful that she was unaware of violence or swords. She was innocent. At that moment, Fear felt disgusted with himself. He had tarnished her innocence with violence and bloodlust. His hand trembled and he dropped his sword. He knelt to the ground, brows furrowed, fighting back tears of frustration, frustration with himself, with the demons, frustration with the world.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"I'm sorry-"<br>
                  <br>"It's okay mister. Don't be sad" The girl said, looking concerned for the bounty hunter.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"E-eh.. you should be running away. I tried to hurt you."&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>It seemed like the girl was finally piecing things together, slow to understand the situation she was just in. "O-oh..." she commented, anxiety flushing over her face. Despite the realization, she still stood there.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Don't you understand? Get lost!" He said, his tone growing more aggressive. The girl made him feel uncomfortable.&nbsp; She stood there for a moment, her eyes filled with a strange compassion. Soon enough, she ran away.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>A few days later, Fear met with his master. He stood in an attacking stance, his intentions clear.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"Hahaha, I wasn't expecting this. You dare raise your sword against me?" Vladinin said. Fear gave no response. Vladinin knew why Fear was doing this, and it sickened him. He would force Fear into a difficult choice, just out of spite. "My son.." he said, though they were hollow words. "I don't wish to fight you"<br>
                  <br>"I'm challenging you, here and now. You've never turned down a challenge." Fear said, eyes full of determination.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"No. Now, if you don't mind, I'm on my way to massacre a village." The demon said, smirking at his own mischeif.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear grew angry. "Why are you being like this!?"<br>
                  <br>Vladinin returned the anger. "I should be asking that to you! You had so much potential, yet you're squandering it with these ridiculous principles. The strong prey on the weak. That is the order of the world! Why do you have to insist on this.. SHIT!"&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear knew words would not get him any further. Him and his master locked eyes, mutual understanding beneath the silence. If Fear turned his blade against the demons, it would not end with Vladinin. More Reapers would come to claim the village. Even more would come to claim his life as betrayal was not tolerated. However, doing nothing would mean the end of this village.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear gestured with his sword, signifying his final decision.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"But WHY?? You don't even know these people!" Vladinin said, his aura growing for combat.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"If you're willing to kill these people against their will, then you are asking to be killed yourself.."<br>
                  <br>"That means you are asking to be killed if you kill me. Don't you understand how ridiculous this is?"<br>
                  <br>"I know. I will accept my fate. I just.. can't let this happen."<br>
                  <br>"I'll make your death quick, then" The demon said, almost sighing.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>"I'm stronger than you think, Master. Thank you for everything."<br>
                  <br>What followed was a blur of bodies and blood. Fear had killed thousands and thousands of demons. He fought and fought. The thing is, he never intended to save the village. It was doomed from the start. He was planning to fight until he died, leaving as many bodies as he could. The village was overrun, and all the people were slaughtered in unsightly manners. Fear's strength left his body, and he closed his eyes, ready for a fatal blow from one of the demons. Just before he was struck, he was transported to a particular shadow world. Fear had unlocked a new part of his power. After waking up days later in this strange land, Fear thought he was dead until he scanned the area with aura. He was able to leave the realm and ended up back in the village. It was now abandoned with the smell of death lingering in the air.&nbsp; His heart felt empty, and he quietly left.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Fear traveled to a new continent and began work as a bounty hunter, capturing and killing law-breaking criminals. It suited him. He lived his life under a strict code, though his attitude made many believe he was just a cold-hearted killer. He preferred it that way anyway. He spent time looking for more work in new places, interested in the secrets of the universe. He found pleasure in gaining knowledge.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>He was looking for a reason to die, or, otherwise, a reason to live.&nbsp;

                            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-8">As stated in the personality section, Fear has a very pragmatic approach to conversation. If someone comes up to him with teasing words and shennanigans, he's likely to respond coldly or sharply. If you want to keep his attention, offer him something of value whether goods, services, or information. Simply raising an interesting topic may work, but no small talk. You, of course, can approach Fear any way you wish, but this is just a tip for those who assume he is unapproachable.&nbsp;</p>

Since Fear is a notorious bounty hunter, he is meant to be very strong and scary. If he loses a lot of fights, he will lose that presence, and, as a result, probably leave the group. It's not that I care about losing at a fundamental ego level, it's just to preserve the character. If I was playing someone else whose life didn't revolve around combat, I really wouldn't care whether he won or lost. Anyway, I may consider T1 combat in the right circumstances. Usually, however, I will try to script the fight beforehand and play it out with known results.&nbsp;</p>

When using this ability, he will fire a short burst of aura to make the movement extremely quick.&nbsp; In harsh light, this ability is slow and predictable. In darkness, it is frighteningly quick and has more range.&nbsp; Fear can also teleport objects or matter of his choosing as long as it is enveloped in the aura.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
